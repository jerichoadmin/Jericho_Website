            description: "The Mexican Redbud is a hardy, drought-resistant tree known for its stunning magenta flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the New Mexico area, Texas, and Northern Mexico, the Mexican Redbud cultivar stands out by being slightly more desert-friendly. It has better heat and drought tolerance, smaller, wavier leaves that resist the sun's rays better, and adapt easier to alkaline and sandy soil substrates. If you live in areas like Rio Rancho known for their sandy soil, this redbud may be the right choice for you. Jericho Nursery generally tries to carry a few kinds of redbuds, so check in with us about the Mexican Redbud.",

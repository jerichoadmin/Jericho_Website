In New Mexico, it’s an exotic addition to gardens but can be a bit finicky due to the state's variable climate. Though it is drought-tolerant once established, Mimosa prefers well-drained soil and moderate water, especially during the hot, dry summer months. While it's not as cold-hardy as other trees, it can perform well in areas with milder winters or protected microclimates. Its fast-growing nature and striking blooms make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in the right conditions.",

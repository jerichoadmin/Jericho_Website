        <h1>Xeriscaping Basics</h1>
        <p>Xeriscaping is a water-efficient landscaping method that uses drought-tolerant plants to create beautiful, sustainable outdoor spaces with minimal irrigation. In Albuquerque’s arid climate, xeric plants thrive by adapting to low rainfall, intense sun, and sandy or rocky soils, making them a smart choice for both residential and commercial landscapes. By incorporating xeric trees, shrubs, cacti, yucca, and ground covers, homeowners can reduce water usage, lower maintenance needs, and create a resilient, eco-friendly yard that stays vibrant year-round.</p>
        <br></br>
      <p>But xeriscaping is more than just choosing drought-tolerant plants—it’s a strategic approach to designing a landscape that works in harmony with New Mexico’s unique environment.</p>


        <h2 className='xeric_core_concepts'>Core Concepts</h2>
        <p>At its core, xeriscaping is about balancing beauty, sustainability, and water efficiency. It starts with selecting the right plants—those that can thrive in dry conditions while adding visual appeal to your yard. Native and xeric plants require less water and support the local ecosystem by attracting pollinators and wildlife. Beyond plant selection, soil health plays a key role, helping retain moisture and provide essential nutrients. Efficient irrigation methods, such as drip systems, ensure water is used effectively, while mulch helps keep the soil cool and minimizes evaporation. Limiting high-water turf areas and opting for low-maintenance plants allows for a landscape that is both stunning and sustainable.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Xeriscaping isn’t just about reducing water use—it’s about creating a thriving, resilient outdoor space that works with the natural climate.</p>
    

        {/* <h2 className='xeric_core_concepts'>Rating Xeric 1 - 3</h2>
        <p>You may have noticed that our plant cards include a Xeric Rating from 1 to 3. While all plants in this section are considered xeric, meaning they thrive with minimal water, some require more moisture than others. For example, butterfly bushes make an excellent xeric addition, attracting pollinators and producing beautiful spring blooms. However, as a deciduous flowering shrub, it still requires more water than a Cholla Cactus, which can survive entirely on rainfall. That’s where our Xeric Rating comes in.</p>
        <p>A butterfly bush would be classified as a <strong>1</strong>—it’s drought-tolerant but on the higher end of water needs among xeric plants. A native Cholla Cactus, on the other hand, earns a <strong>3</strong>—it’s one of the most water-wise choices available, thriving with zero irrigation beyond natural rainfall. In between, we have our <strong>2-rated plants</strong>, such as Rocky Mountain Junipers, Chinese Pistaches, and Oklahoma Redbuds—all low-water, resilient choices that sit between a cactus and a deciduous shrub in terms of water efficiency.</p>
